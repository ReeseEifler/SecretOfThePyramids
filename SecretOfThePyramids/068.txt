"I can do without your infirmary," says Bruce.
"The only thing I want is a ride out of here."
"All in good time, all in good time. First, I must
explain to you that I am Ptah, direct descendant
of the pharaohs. I am here to complete their
work. I intend to conquer the world."
"And just how do you plan to pull off that little
feat?" asks Bruce.
"With your help, of course, Professor. Several
Russian scientists were on the verge of completing
a particle-beam ray gun. By various means I
have had them brought here. They have almost
completed their work. And now, with you to help
them, they will be done in no time at all. When it
is finished, the ray will be directed at a mirror on a
space platform that I have already placed in orbit
around the earth. I will then be able to bounce
the ray back to any point on earth, utterly destroying
the targets that I choose. If you refuse to
help me, you will be imprisoned on the space
platform. I give you exactly one hour to make up
your mind."
The guards take you and Bruce to a small
room with barred windows and lock you in.

   Do you and Bruce pretend to go along with Ptah in order to play for TIME?

                                 OR

                 Do you try to ESCAPE without delay?
