You tell Ahmed that you would rather go back
to the hotel, try to find Andrea, and get her
opinion before you do anything.
You return to the hotel in a cab and check
Andrea's room. No sign of her. You leave the
hotel not quite knowing what to do.
At the corner a native woman, with a dark veil
covering her head and face, except for the eyes,
beckons from a doorway. You are surprised to
see that her eyes are pale gray. You are even
more surprised when you hear her voice. The
woman is Andrea in disguise!
"Follow me quickly," she says.
You have to run to keep up with her. She leads
you through a labyrinth of teeming alleyways.
Finally you reach a stone building with a heavy,
carved door.
