"I think we had better go down to my office,"
says Ahmed. "I want you to look through my
photo file."
The inspector's office at headquarters is cluttered
but organized in its own way. A row of file
cabinets lines one side of the room. Ahmed pulls
out a folder, opens it on one of the few bare
sections of his long desk, and spreads out a collection
of photographs for you to study.
Somehow you are not surprised to see the man
from the plane in one of the photos. You tell
Ahmed the whole story.
"The man you recognize is a member of the
Assassins," says Ahmed. "This just confirms what
I told you before. Through informers, I have discovered
the secret desert headquarters of the Assassins.
There is a strike force of paratroopers and
a dozen helicopters waiting to attack. We must act
as soon as possible."
"If you are going to raid the hideout of the
kidnappers," you say, "I think I should go along."
"It is true that Professor Hockney is your uncle,"
says Ahmed. "However, this mission may
prove to be very dangerous. I advise you not to
go, but of course the decision is yours."
