  Another guard appears at the door of the room.

  "Ahmed won't be coming back," he says. "All of us left at the villa are 
members of the Assassins. We have infiltrated Ahmed's organization."

  Two other members of the Assassins enter the room, guns drawn. They lead you 
down to a dungeon in the basement of the villa and chain you to an iron ring 
set in the stone wall.

  You realize that you're going to be a "guest" of the Assassins for a very 
long time.
