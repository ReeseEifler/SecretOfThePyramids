  The picture blurs. A kind of fog drifts over the screen and then clears 
away. The pyramid is completed. But what a pyramid! It appears to be early
morning. The top third of the pyramid is sheathed in gold, polished to a 
mirror finish. The rest of the pyramid is painted in iridescent colors in 
horizontal stripes clear to the bottom.

  The early sunlight strikes the top of the pyramid and throws a blinding 
shaft of light straight up into the sky.

  You are so fascinated by this scene that it takes you several minutes to 
realize that the triangular viewscreen is gradually growing larger.

  As you watch, the entire wall of the room becomes a viewscreen, and the 
other three walls vanish completely. The glowing floor remains, but you seem 
to be standing in ancient Egypt!
