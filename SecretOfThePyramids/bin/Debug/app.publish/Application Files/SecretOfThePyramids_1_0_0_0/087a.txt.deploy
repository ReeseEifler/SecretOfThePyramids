  You wake up to find yourself lying on an iron cot in a small storeroom. You 
sit up and try to move, and find that one ankle is chained to the bed.

  Gradually your eyes become accustomed to the darkness. There is a small 
window high above you on the wall, and through it you can see a crescent moon 
shining. You can hear the beat of the music you heard in the cafe. You sit 
there in the half-darkness trying to figure out how to pick the ancient-looking
padlock that secures the chain on your ankle.

  The door to the room opens slightly, throwing a shaft of light inside. It's 
bright enough for you to recognize the dancer from the cafe. Quietly she closes
the door and whispers in your ear.

  "My name is Serena. I will help you escape."
