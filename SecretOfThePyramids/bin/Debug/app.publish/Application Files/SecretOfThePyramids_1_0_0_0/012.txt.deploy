  "What is the trouble here?" asks the inspector.

  "My uncle has been kidnapped from the hotel," you say.

  "Is your uncle Professor Hockney?" asks the inspector.

like this might happen."

  "I think I saw the kidnappers in a truck behind the hotel," you report 
anxiously.

  You and the inspector run to the back entrance
of the hotel, but the truck is gone.
