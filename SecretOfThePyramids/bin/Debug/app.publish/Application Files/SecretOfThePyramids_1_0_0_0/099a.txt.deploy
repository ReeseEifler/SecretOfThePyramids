  Up ahead you see another oasis. Is it another mirage? You head for it anyway.
One part of the desert is as good as any other when it comes to leaving your 
sun-dried bones.

  You get there first. "This is water! Actual water!" you exclaim. "This is not
a mirage!"

  You dunk your entire head in the water. Nothing has ever felt better in your
life.
