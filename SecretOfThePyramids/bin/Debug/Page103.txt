You might as well take a chance and try the
jump. You step back a few feet, make a short run,
and take a flying leap to the other roof. You manage
to grab the edge with your hands as you slip
down along the side of the building. You struggle
to pull yourself up. You are about to lose your
grip when a strong arm grabs you by the wrist

she says, "before I was kidnapped by the evil
gang that owns the cafe."
"Why haven't you tried to escape before?" you
ask.
"I have," she says, "but it's not that easy. They
control this quarter of Cairo completely. Now my
family has discovered where I am and has arranged
my escape—but you will see. We must
hurry. I hear someone coming."
