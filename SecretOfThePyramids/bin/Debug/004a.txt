  There's no telling what kind of trouble you might get into if you just run 
off after this guy without really knowing where you are going. 

  You toss your bag into the back of a cab.

  "Star and Crescent Hotel," you tell the driver. When you arrive, Andrea is 
waiting for you in the lobby. She helps you check in.

  The bellboy insists on carrying your bag, even though you are traveling 
light. As you leave the elevator and head for your room, you could swear that 
the door, which was slightly ajar, closed as you approached. Maybe it was the 
wind, but the air seems very still. And after that warning note at the airport,
you don't want to take any chances.
