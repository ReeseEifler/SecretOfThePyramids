As you start to leave the platform, the approaching
figure greets you.
"My name is Imhotep. I greet you from the
past"
"For a while there I thought we were in the
past," you say.
"No, I am not actually here at the moment, and
you are not back in ancient Egypt. This is a
recording—a three-dimensional hologram. My
image is programmed to respond to individual
personalities such as yours. Even though you
may feel my arm as solid—here, I will touch your
hand—it is only an illusion. It is too complex to
explain, but your descendants will understand
someday, just as you know that when you listen
to a radio there are not little people in the box
making the sounds."
"You are the most celebrated character in
Egyptian history," says Hassan. "You were—or
are—the greatest genius that ever lived."
"It is true that I gave your species a bit of help. I
taught them the rudiments of architecture, farming,
mathematics, engineering, and medicine.
That was five thousand years ago. But I am not
sure I was wise to do it. I will have to decide that
when I find time to return. Your planet is in my
study quadrant, but it is far out on the edge of the
galaxy."
As he speaks, the image of Imhotep seems to
blur a bit.
