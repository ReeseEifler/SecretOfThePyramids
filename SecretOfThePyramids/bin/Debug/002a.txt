  The next few days are a blur of preparations. Before you know it, you and 
Bruce are on a TWA jet heading for Rome on the first leg of the trip to Cairo.
  
  On the plane, your uncle explains his plan to place special instruments in a 
chamber under the center of the largest pyramid at Giza. He hopes to test the 
pyramid's effect on the paths of cosmic rays—rays made up of high-speed 
particles from space that usually penetrate deep into the ground.
  
  "If my theory is correct," he says, "these rays could be concentrated by the 
pyramid to produce an unlimited amount of energy."
  
  While Bruce is talking, you notice that a man nearby is straining to hear 
him. No doubt he's just curious. He is strange-looking, though!
