  When you are finished dressing, the niche widens to become a door. You step 
into a large chamber. You find that the humming comes from a chorus gathered 
around a large stone sarcophagus. Inside this is a coffin in the shape of a
person. The lid floats a few feet in the air. On one end of the lid is a 
lifelike sculpture in gold. With a shock you recognize it. It is your own face.
