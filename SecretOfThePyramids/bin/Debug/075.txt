"Now!" shouts Bruce. "Put in your earplugs—
fast!"
When you do, everything snaps back to normal.
Only you, Bruce, and the Russians have
earplugs. Ptah and his men fall to the ground
holding their heads. Seconds later they lose consciousness.
"Let's get down to the dock where Ptah has his
motor launch," says Bruce. "The guards there will
be unconscious too."
You run down to the boat, jump in, and advance
the throttle to full speed. In a few minutes a
titanic explosion rips the island behind you, but
you are already miles away.
"When we get back to Cairo," says Bruce, "my
new Russian friends have agreed to help us
search for an unlimited energy source—something
that will benefit all mankind."
The End
