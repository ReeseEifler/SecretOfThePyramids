You pull open the door and dash down a corridor that leads back into the cafe. 
You run outside. Two men from the cafe race after you, shouting in Arabic. You 
push your way through the crowds, trying to stay hidden. Which way to go? There 
is an open door on your right with a small courtyard inside. You decide to 
chance it and dart through the door, slamming it behind you. You lean against 
the door, gasping for breath.

A hulk of a man appears. He has a heavy, dark beard and piercing eyes.

"Welcome to my house," he says. "Have you come to buy a magic spell or perhaps 
something to ward off the evil eye?"

"I need help," you say. "Someone is after me."

"In that case, you are welcome in my humble house. You are safe here. I am 
Al-Din, the magician. My magic will protect you."

You follow Al-Din up a flight of stairs into a room with a low table 
surrounded by cushions. He serves you some mint tea and tells you about
the ancient magic he practices.
"All is illusion," he says. "Here, I will show you.
Close your eyes and repeat this spell three times:
abah arah arah abah blah ah."
