You are anxious to get to the hotel to find
Bruce and Andrea. You feel you cannot go to
Serena's village.
You thank Serena for her help and slip out of
the cart.
Where are you? The pale moon lights up an
eerie landscape. Stretching in every direction are
small buildings, all deserted. You wander up and
down the silent streets until you finally see a
group of people huddled in front of a small fire.
The night is cool, and they gesture for you to join
them. You stay with them until dawn.
With the light of day you realize that you are in
a very large cemetery. Those small buildings must
be tombs! You're not sure of the way out, but you
pick a direction and keep going. Finally you reach
a small store just outside the cemetery. You find a
telephone and call Bruce at the hotel.
"Bruce," you begin, "I'm in this store just outside
of a huge cemetery; where all the tombs are
miniature buildings, and . . . "
"I know exactly where that is," says Bruce.
"Just sit tight until I get there. I'm leaving right
away."
In the cab on the way back to the hotel you are
almost relieved when Bruce tells you that he has
to rush back to the States on urgent business and
that you and he are booked on the next flight to
New York.

                 The End
