  Suddenly you are caught up in a whirlwind and shot straight up through the 
pyramid. You look down and see the pyramid receding below you. The top of the 
pyramid has become a huge, glistening eye, shooting rays of light in all 
directions. Below it are bands of glowing color. As you concentrate on the eye,
your body seems to dissolve. You become the eye—all-seeing, all-knowing. Your 
mind expands to encompass the universe, to fill infinite space. All the 
mysteries of existence are now understandable.

  Your mind and body return to earth. Suddenly you know where Bruce is being 
held. With your hgnew powers you contact him telepathically. Later the police 
are amazed when you are able to lead them directly to the hideout of the 
Assassins — where Bruce has been imprisoned — in one of the old quarters of 
Cairo.
  From now on, you will find a whole new life of joy and dangers.


                                    The End
