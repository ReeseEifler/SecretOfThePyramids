  "Dr. Ptah! Who is that'" you ask.

  But Bruce has no time to answer. The plane is landing. The door of the small
compartment opens. Three men grab you and Bruce by the ankles and pull you out
of the plane, dumping you on the ground like two sacks of potatoes.

  You look around. You're at one end of a long, narrow, sandy island, bare 
except for a few palm trees and a large pyramid-shaped building. Down the 
beach there is a pier with a motor launch moored to it. One of the men cuts 
the ropes on your feet and wrists, then does the same for Bruce. More men 
appear, carrying rifles.
