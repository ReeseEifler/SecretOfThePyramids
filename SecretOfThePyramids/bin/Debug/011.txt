Bruce seemingly agrees to cooperate, and Ptah
is delighted. Bruce is sent under guard to work in
the laboratory located in a vast complex under
the pyramid.
A few days later, Bruce manages to talk to you
without the guards overhearing.
"The Russian scientists were also kidnapped,"
whispers Bruce. "Fortunately I can speak a little
Russian. We're trying to come up with a way to
escape."
Three weeks later, the ray gun is ready for its
first formal test. You, Bruce, and the Russians—
as well as Ptah and his top henchmen—mount a
large ceremonial stand in front of the pyramid. As
Ptah watches the barrel of the ray gun emerge
from the top of the pyramid, Bruce slips something
into your hand.
"Put these plugs in your ears when I give you
the signal," Bruce whispers.
Technicians inside the pyramid throw the
switches to activate the ray gun. A low whirring
sound fills the air. It rises in pitch as it gets
louder—louder and louder, and higher and
higher. Soon it begins to hurt your ears. Your
arms and legs become numb, and your vision
starts to blur.
