"It is better to do something—anything—rather
than sit here and wait to die," you say.
Ahmed scrapes his digital watch free of dirt.
"It's 1:10 P.M. It is already afternoon," he says.
"Our best bet is to head west, toward the sun.
Later we can follow it as it sets. In the morning we
will head away from the rising sun. If the sun
becomes obscured by haze, we will stay where
we are. Otherwise we will run the risk of wandering
around in circles."
You start off. Up and down sand dunes, and
then up and down again. Occasionally you stop
to wet your lips from Ahmed's canteen.
Then you see it An oasis shimmers in the
distance—a glistening pond surrounded by palm
trees.
"Look, look!" you say to Ahmed. Ahmed is
strangely calm.
"I'm sorry, but that is just a mirage—a trick the
desert plays on the eyes, my friend," he says.
After another mile or so of hiking, you realize
that Ahmed is right. Nothing is there. Sheets of
water seem to materialize, then vanish after you
have walked a few yards.
A few hours later, you stop suddenly. "Ahmed,
am I crazy or do I hear thunder in the distance?
Are there sound mirages in the desert?"
