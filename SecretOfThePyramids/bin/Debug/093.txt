  Ahmed scrapes his digital watch free of dirt. "It's 1:10 P.M. It is already 
afternoon," he says. "Our best bet is to head west, toward the sun. Later we 
can follow it as it sets. In the morning we will head away from the rising sun.
If the sun becomes obscured by haze, we will stay where we are. Otherwise we 
will run the risk of wandering around in circles."

  You start off. Up and down sand dunes, and then up and down again. 
Occasionally you stop to wet your lips from Ahmed's canteen.
