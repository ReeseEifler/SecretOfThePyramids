"We've got to go down there now. My uncle
may be in grave danger."
You and Ahmed start down the side of the
dune toward the pyramids.
Suddenly a troop of desert warriors on camels
appears from nowhere and comes charging
toward you. Dark headcloths cover their faces
except for their eyes. But instead of the old, long
rifles you have seen them carrying in pictures,
they all have modern submachine guns—and
they are all pointed at you.
One of the warriors commands you to raise
your hands and march toward the pyramids.
A door opens in the base of one of the smaller
pyramids, and you and Ahmed are forced into
the vault inside. The door snaps shut behind you.
You realize that the "floor" you're standing on is a
conveyor belt that is rapidly carrying you toward
a wall of flame at the other end of the vault. You
try frantically to run back to the door, but the belt
is too fast. You are both swept into the thermal
chamber—a chamber that so concentrates the
energy of the sun that any object entering it is
instantly vaporized.
The End
