You are relaxing one afternoon after school when you get a phone call from your 
uncle Bruce, a brilliant scientist and world traveler.

"I'm just in from Egypt," he says. "I have to get some new equipment to continue 
my investigations of the Pyramids. How would you like to go back with me for a 
few weeks?"

You have always envied Bruce—dashing off to exotic places in the Middle East and 
the Orient, sometimes vanishing for months at a time. It doesn't take you long 
to make up your mind to go.
