  You rush back into your room and throw on some clothes. Then back to the 
window. It is a bit lighter now. Dawn is just breaking. On the street you see 
two men, loading a large basket into the back of an old panel truck. From this 
height — and in the still-dim light — you can't be sure, but something tells 
you that one of them is the stranger who gave you the note. You also have a 
strong suspicion that your uncle is in the basket. How did they get him down 
to the street?

  It is suddenly very quiet in the next room.

  "Bruce, are you all right?" you call through the door. There is no answer. 
You throw open the door. Bruce is gone!

  The room is a mess. Sheets trail across the floor as if a struggle had taken 
place. In several places there are drops of blood. The screen covering the
window has been pushed in. There are more spots of blood on the windowsill and 
on the small ledge outside. You look down. There is a four-storydrop to the 
street.
