Again you are tied up and carried off. You are
taken to the other end of the island where a
rocket is ready to blast off to resupply Ptah's orbiting
space station. You and Bruce are dumped
into a small compartment in the rocket.
You are already working your hands free as
you blast off.
"The crew is going to be too busy for awhile to
bother about us," you say. "If we can break out of
this compartment and get the jump on them,
maybe we can take over the ship. Then we can
put Ptah's space station out of action for good."
You know that you'll need a lot of luck to get
out of this situation—a lot more than you're likely
to get.
The End
