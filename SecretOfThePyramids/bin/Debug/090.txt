You go back up the shaft, using the hand rope
to help pull yourself along. After a short way—it
seems very soon this time—the shaft levels out.
But you walk on and on—and see no exit. You
stop and go back. You reach the point where the
shaft goes down, but now the hand rope is missing.
Where are you? In a panic you run back the
other way. Your heart is pounding and your
palms are sweaty.
Now you edge carefully forward, pointing your
flashlight down seemingly endless passageways.
You reach a fork in the tunnel. You don't remember
a fork there before! Your hands and knees are
shaking, but you force yourself to go on. More
forks! You have somehow blundered into a maze
of tunnels.
You stop for a moment to think. How can you
possibly find your way out? Then you remember
a rule to follow when you're trapped in a maze:
"Every time you reach a fork, turn right." Remembering
this calms your nerves somewhat.
Now maybe you have a chance.
Wearily you start to retrace your steps. You just
hope that the rule works. At best you know that it
will be a long walk.
The End
