  You stay with Serena's people, one of the many tribes of Dervishes, for 
several days while she manages to get word secretly to Bruce that you are safe.

  At last Bruce and Andrea arrive at the village.

  "Thank goodness you're all right," says Bruce. "Andrea and I followed your 
trail to the cafe. The police raided the place and uncovered a nest of foreign 
agents code named SPHINX. But by then you were gone. Later, when we returned to
the hotel, we found Serena's note telling us where you were.

  "Unfortunately, I had to tell your parents that you were missing. They have
been very worried. I guess you'd better catch a plane home and show them that
you are really all right. I am sorry you had only one day in Egypt."
