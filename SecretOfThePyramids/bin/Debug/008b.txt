  You have never liked official tours of any sort — you are too independent — 
but you see the logic of Mohammed's suggestion. As the group starts into the 
pyramid, you and Mohammed fall in behind. You enter a low, narrow passageway
which leads to a large gallery with a high ceiling. The guide begins a long, 
dull lecture.

  "Do we have to follow this tour?" you ask Mohammed.

  "If I may presume to suggest an alternative," says Mohammed, "I myself was 
once employed as a guide in this very pyramid. If you would like me to show 
you some of the lesser passageways, I would be glad to guide you."
