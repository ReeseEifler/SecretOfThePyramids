  "This chamber is the lowest point of an inverted pyramid, the exact mirror 
image of the one above. This is the true magical form discovered by the 
ancients. Only the upper, aboveground half of this form is known to those 
outside our order. We are revealing our secret to you because we hope that you
will join us. Your uncle is one of our initiates. He is now in great danger. 
If you become a member of our order, you will be much better equipped to find 
him."

  "Psychic energy is collected above and then concentrated down here. This 
energy will transform your being—and initiate you into the Order of Light.

given profound responsibilities. Your life can no longer be a simple one, but 
must be dedicated to fighting the forces of darkness."
