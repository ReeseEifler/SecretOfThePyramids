The strange man is already in a cab when you reach the stand in front of the 
terminal. You manage to jump into the next cab in line.

"Do you speak English?" you ask.

"I speak much English, meestehr."

"Good, then follow that cab," you tell him.

Your cab weaves in and out of the heavy traffic, with its horn blaring 
constantly. Your driver just barely misses one car after another. However, he 
does manage to keep less than a block behind the other car. The fast-moving 
traffic slows to a snail's pace once you get into an older section of the city. 
The cab you are following stops, and the strange man gets out. You hand your 
driver a couple of American bills, hoping they cover your fare. Fortunately, 
the driver seems more than pleased as you leave the cab. You can barely see 
through the thick crowd, but you do catch a glimpse of the man you are 
following. He is entering what looks like a cafe. You push your way over to the 
entrance.
