You slide down the drainpipe to the balcony
below, and then begin to lower yourself to the
street. You try not to look down. Carefully you
reach around with your foot for whatever footholds
you can find sticking out from the building.
It is easier than you had expected.
Finally you make it down to the street. You can
still see the truck. It's only a block away, stuck in
traffic. You push your way through the crowded
street as fast as you can to catch up to it
Out of breath, you reach the back of the truck.
You jump on and struggle with the doors. They
fly open suddenly, and you fall back onto the
street, banging your knee. Hopping painfully on
one leg, you get up and pull yourself into the
truck.
