You stay with Serena's people, one of the many
tribes of Dervishes, for several days while she
manages to get word secretly to Bruce that you
are safe.
At last Bruce and Andrea arrive at the village.
"Thank goodness you're all right," says Bruce.
"Andrea and I followed your trail to the cafe. The
police raided the place and uncovered a nest of
foreign agents code named SPHINX. But by then
you were gone. Later, when we returned to the
hotel, we found Serena's note telling us where
you were.
"Unfortunately, I had to tell your parents that
you were missing. They have been very worried. I
guess you'd better catch a plane home and show
them that you are really all right. I am sorry you
had only one day in Egypt."
Back in the States, whenever you see the
dawn, you think of those white-robed figures
chanting their hymn to the first light of day.
You weren't in Egypt very long, but it was an
adventure you'll never forget.
The End
