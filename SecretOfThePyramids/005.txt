"They must have hit us with a grenade,"
Mohammed says. "It's a good thing this limo is
armor-plated."
Mohammed has been on the two-way police
radio from the moment you jumped into the car.
Now information comes back that the police are
surrounding the area.
"They won't catch anyone," says Mohammed.
"These terrorists are professionals. They will disappear
back into the old quarter of the city in a
matter of minutes."
Two police jeeps arrive almost immediately. Policemen
begin to fan out around the area, You
and Mohammed transfer to one of the jeeps, and
it speeds off to Inspector Ahmed's villa, its siren
wailing.
