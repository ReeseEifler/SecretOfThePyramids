The three of you just make it back into the
tunnel when an explosion rocks the room and a
section of the floor crashes into some unknown
abyss below. Then there is silence. Clouds of dust
rise from the gaping hole. You wait for several
minutes, hardly daring to breathe.
"I think that's all that is going to happen for the
moment," says Hassan.
"Hold on to my legs," says Bruce. He crawls
back into the room and leans over the edge of the
opening, playing his flashlight down into the
space below. "Seems to be some kind of chamber,
probably an ancient tomb. The floor is about
fifteen feet down. It's lucky we brought a rope
along."
"This is a great discovery!" exclaims Hassan.
"We must climb down at once."
"I don't know if we should all go," says Bruce,
looking at you. "We don't know what kind of a
sticky situation we might be getting into. It might
be better if you run back and bring help while
Hassan and I climb down."
