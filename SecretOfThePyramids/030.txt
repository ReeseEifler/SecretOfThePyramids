  "Let's get to the car."

  "There's an exit to our right that doesn't seem to be covered," says 
Mohammed. "I will count to five. Then we will get up from the table and move as
quickly as we can out that door. Don't run unless they start shooting, then 
keep low. Ready? One, two, three, four, five."

  Your feet feel like lead, and even though you know you are moving as fast as 
you can, it feels like slow motion. Somehow you make it through the exit and 
into the car. You look back to see armed figures running in your direction. 
The car roars away from the curb. WHAM! Something smacks the car with terrific 
force.
