You are not sure what is going to happen to
you in the pyramid, but if Bruce and Andrea want
to go in, you don't see how you can refuse.
All three of you enter. The door closes behind
you.
"This is a data module," a voice begins. "I will
respond telepathically to your brain waves and
will answer all of your questions."
"What is the real secret of the Pyramids?" you
ask.
"This module is the secret," the voice answers.
"It was left here by the galactic traveler Imhotep in
star year four billion ninety-four. This module was
connected by hyperspace relay to the main galactic
computer located in the Sirius star system.
Other pyramids were built to imitate this shape so
that the secret could be protected until the right
time."
The door to the module reopens, and the three
of you step out into the sunlight.
"This is the greatest discovery of my life,"
Bruce says after a few moments of silence. "This
is even more exciting than what I had hoped to
find when I came to Egypt. It would be catastrophic
if this secret fell into the wrong hands.
But if we use its information properly, we might
be able to solve all of the problems of the world."
The End
