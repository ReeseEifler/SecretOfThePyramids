The next few days are a blur of preparations. Before you know it, you and Bruce
are on a TWA jet heading for Rome on the first leg of the trip to Cairo.

On the plane, your uncle explains his plan to place special instruments in a 
chamber under the center of the largest pyramid at Giza. He hopes to test the 
pyramid's effect on the paths of cosmic rays—rays made up of high-speed 
particles from space that usually penetrate deep into the ground.

"If my theory is correct," he says, "these rays could be concentrated by the 
pyramid to produce an unlimited amount of energy."

While Bruce is talking, you notice that a man nearby is straining to hear him.
No doubt he's just curious. He is strange-looking, though! In Rome you change 
to an Egyptair jet You are startled to notice the same man from the other jet 
aboard your Cairo-bound plane.

"I will have lots of red tape to take care of at the airport when we land," 
says Bruce. "Why don't you just breeze through customs and take a cab to the 
Star and Crescent Hotel, where we're staying? My assistant, Andrea, will be 
waiting there for you. She can get you settled in our room while my equipment 
is unloaded from the plane."

As soon as you land, Bruce is off to the baggage area, leaving you alone in a 
foreign land. As if that isn't enough, the stranger from the plane appears and 
hands you a small, folded piece of paper, then dashes toward the taxi stand 
outside the terminal.
