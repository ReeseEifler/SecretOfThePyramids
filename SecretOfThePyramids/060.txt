  You must save yourself and Bruce. Your instinct takes over as you reach for 
a short length of pipe on the floor of the truck and lunge at the larger of the
two men. You hit his hand with the pipe. He backs off, howling with pain, and 
you jump out of the truck. But where is the other man? Wham! He gets you from 
behind.

  You wake up bound hand and foot in a small compartment. You can tell you're 
aboard an airplane from the sound and the vibrations.

  Your uncle is tied up next to you. He has a wide, bloodstained bandage around
his head.

  "Where are we?" you ask. "And who are these people?"

  "I'm not positive. But my suspicion is that we've been kidnapped by the 
infamous Dr. Ptah."
