  Did Mohammed push you into the well? Did you really slip and fall? You can't
tell. You grit your teeth and wonder how far you will fall before you hit 
bottom. You can still hear the humming. It grows louder. You SHOULD be 
terrified — falling down a bottomless shaft in the center of an ancient 
pyramid, maybe to your death. But you are strangely calm. The musical note 
seems to have something to do with it. And your rate of falling has slowed. A 
strong blast of air from below is cushioning your fall.

  Suddenly you land — on your feet. You look around you, amazed. You are on a 
small platform in the center of an amphitheater of some sort. Around you in a 
circle are nine white-robed figures on large stone thrones. A central figure
sitting on the largest throne speaks:

  "We have been expecting you."
