Quickly you unfold the note. Scrawled in red ink are the words "Beware the 
Sphinx." You have heard about the statue of the Sphinx next to the Pyramids. 
But why should you beware of it? The thought occurs to you that "sphinx" could 
be a code word and not refer to the actual Sphinx at all. Maybe the note is a 
meaningless hoax. On the other hand, it could spell danger for you and Bruce. 
You remember the time you felt an urge to get off a bus in your hometown—just 
before it was hit by a truck. Now you have a hunch that you should follow this 
man.

                           Do you try to FOLLOW him? 

                                       OR 

                Do you decide that it is wiser to go to your HOTEL?
