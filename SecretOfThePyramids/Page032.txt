Your threat of going to another hotel seems to
do the trick. The clerk sighs and mutters something
about tourists. Nevertheless, he directs the
porter to carry your bag to a new room.
"What is this all about?" asks Andrea.
"I'm not sure myself, but a man at the airport
handed me a warning note. If we are in danger,
changing our room may throw our pursuer off, or
at least show him we are on our guard."
"Well, I think this is a lot of nonsense," Andrea
says.
Your new "suite" consists of two small rooms
with a connecting door. The first room is windowless;
the second has a small window covered by a
screen of very elaborate grillwork. Andrea's room
is on the other side of the hotel, not far from your
original room.
Bruce arrives a short time later. You tell him
about the warning note and explain why you've
changed rooms.
"Splendid!" he exclaims. "You must always
follow your hunches, especially when danger is
involved. Now I suggest that we go out on the
town for the evening. You don't want to miss the
Sahara Club and its famous belly dancers."
