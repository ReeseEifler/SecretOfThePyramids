A waiter brings you a long-handled pot containing thick, strong coffee. He 
pours it ceremoniously into a small porcelain cup. It tastes somewhat bitter, 
but not too bad. You sip it slowly as you watch the dancing. Is it your 
imagination, or does the dancer keep glancing in your direction? The music 
grows louder. The lights get brighter. You can't seem to focus your eyes. Your 
arms and legs feel like lead, and you can't move them. You feel dizzy. You feel 
like you are passing out!
