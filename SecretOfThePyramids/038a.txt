  "We've got to go down there now. My uncle may be in grave danger."

  You and Ahmed start down the side of the dune toward the pyramids.

charging toward you. Dark headcloths cover their faces except for their eyes.

  One of the warriors commands you to raise your hands and march toward the 
pyramids.
