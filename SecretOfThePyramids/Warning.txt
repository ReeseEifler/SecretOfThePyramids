This game is has been masquerading as a book.  It is not a book.  It is a game! 
It contains many different adventures you can have in the land of the Pyramids. 
From time to time as you read along, you will be asked to make a choice. Your 
choice may lead to success or disaster. The adventures you take are a result of 
your choices. You are responsible because you choose. After you make each 
choice, follow the instructions to see what happens to you next. Think carefully 
BEFORE you make a move. Any choice might be your last... or it may lead you to
the secret of the Pyramids.
