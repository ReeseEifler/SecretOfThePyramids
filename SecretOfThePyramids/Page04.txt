There's no telling what kind of trouble you might get into if you just run off 
after this guy without really knowing where you are going. You toss your bag 
into the back of a cab.

"Star and Crescent Hotel," you tell the driver.

When you arrive, Andrea is waiting for you in the lobby. She helps you check in.
The bellboy insists on carrying your bag, even though you are traveling light.
As you leave the elevator and head for your room, you could swear that the door,
which was slightly ajar, closed as you approached. Maybe it was the wind, but 
the air seems very still. And after that warning note at the airport, you don't
want to take any chances.

"Wait," you say. "I don't want this room. I don't like the location."

The bellboy looks confused, and Andrea seems shocked. You haven't had a chance 
to tell her about the note.

"I'll explain later," you tell Andrea. "Right now I'm going to go back down to 
the lobby and ask for a different room."

But at the check-in desk, the clerk will not listen to you. What will you do?

You threaten to go to another hotel unless the clerk agrees to CHANGE your room?

                                OR

             You decide you're imagining things and 
        let the clerk talk you into taking your ORIGINAL room?
