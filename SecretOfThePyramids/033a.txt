  "I think we had better go down to my office," says Ahmed. "I want you to 
look through my photo file."

  The inspector's office at headquarters is cluttered but organized in its own 
way. A row of file cabinets lines one side of the room. Ahmed pulls out a 
folder, opens it on one of the few bare sections of his long desk, and spreads 
out a collection of photographs for you to study.

  Somehow you are not surprised to see the man from the plane in one of the 
photos. You tell Ahmed the whole story.

  "The man you recognize is a member of the Assassins," says Ahmed. "This just 
confirms what I told you before. Through informers, I have discovered the 
secret desert headquarters of the Assassins. There is a strike force of 
paratroopers and a dozen helicopters waiting to attack. We must act as soon as 
possible."
