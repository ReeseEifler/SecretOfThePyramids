You repeat Al-Din's spell three times. The room
begins to spin around you, then fades away altogether.
You seem to be floating in a void. Are
you asleep? Dreaming? You find yourself flying
high up over the ocean on what could be a magic
carpet.
You awaken in your living room back home.
The phone is ringing. You answer it. Your uncle is
on the phone.
"I'm just in from Egypt," he says. "I have to get
some new equipment to continue my investigations
of the Pyramids. How would you like to go
back with me for a few weeks?"
This is really strange. Did you just dream everything
that happened, or did that magician really
send you back here to start over?

              Do you think that it was just a dream, 
			     and you would still like to GO?

                              OR

            Do you say NO, knowing what is in store for you?
