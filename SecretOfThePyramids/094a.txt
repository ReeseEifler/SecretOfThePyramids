  The submersible car journeys up the river, just under the surface of the 
water.

  "Not long ago," says Bruce, "I discovered the entrance to an underwater 
tunnel that goes from the Nile to the famous step pyramid at Sakkara. They say
Imhotep's tomb is there. I haven't had a chance to explore this tunnel until 
now."

  When you reach Sakkara, the car enters the underwater runnel. Soon you 
surface on a broad lake in an underground cavern. In the center of the lake is
an island, and in the center of the island is a small pyramid about thirty 
feet high. It is made of a dull, silvery metal — perhaps platinum. Bruce 
steers the car to the edge of the island. The three of you jump ashore. As you
do, a large opening appears in the side of the pyramid. A voice comes from 
inside.
