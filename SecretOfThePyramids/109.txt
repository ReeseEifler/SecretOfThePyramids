"You have thirty seconds left," says the voice
from inside the pyramid. "After that, you may no
longer enter."
"I'm not just going to walk into that thing," you
say. "Not unless I know more about it."
"If that's your honest choice," says Bruce, "Andrea
and I will respect it. And in that case, I guess
we'll all stay out."
"This module will now suspend operations for
one galactic minute—which is four hundred and
seventy-five Earth years," says the voice.
The door closes. You can find no trace of it on
the surface of the pyramid.
"1 wonder what would have happened if we
had gone inside?" you ask.
"Well, we can come back in four hundred and
seventy-five years and find out," says Bruce.
"Or we can come back now with special equipment,"
says Andrea, "and try to pry its secrets
loose."
You are already looking forward to that.
The End
