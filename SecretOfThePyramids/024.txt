  One by one you, Bruce, and Hassan slide down the rope into the chamber below.
It is a large room. In the center are huge chunks of rock and other debris that
must have fallen from the ceiling. At one end of the room is a door leading to 
another chamber.

  As you approach the door it opens automatically. This startles all of you for
a moment. Carefully you peer inside. You are hardly prepared for what you see.

	The room is illuminated with some kind of strange light. The walls and 
ceiling are made of a plastic material with a honeycomb pattern, and they seem 
to glow with an inner luminescence. In the center, perched on a glistening 
metal rail, is some kind of futuristic device.
