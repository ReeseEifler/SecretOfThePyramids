Just as you get to the wall, a panel opens and
reveals a lighted niche. Inside is a very elaborate
and jeweled costume—a ceremonial costume of
ancient Egypt. The humming grows even louder
now. You feel compelled to exchange your
clothes for the long robe, the headdress, and the
sandals in front of you. You put them on. You
want to stop yourself, but you can't.
