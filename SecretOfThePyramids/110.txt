You follow her through passageways that are
so narrow you can barely squeeze through.
Sometimes you can hear shouting nearby and
see the flickering beams of flashlights searching
the dark corners where you were standing only
seconds before. Finally, in a narrow alley, Serena
stops and listens for a few moments.
"See that donkey cart over there," she whispers.
"It is from my village. I have arranged for it
to meet me here. I will crawl into the bottom of it.
Watch how I do it, then follow."
There is just room enough for you to squeeze
into the cart. Serena arranges the straw over the
two of you and then signals to the driver with a
low whistle.
The cart starts off. You go through narrow alleyways,
then down larger streets. Gradually the
street noises die away, and you guess that you are
outside the city.
"I think we are safely away from our pursuers,"
says Serena. "If you wish, you may find your way
from here. If you continue with me to my village,
you will be welcome there."

                Do you decide to GET OUT of the cart?

                                 OR

            Do you decide to CONTINUE on to Serena's village?
