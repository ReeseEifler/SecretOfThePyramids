  The strange man is already in a cab when you reach the stand in front of the 
terminal. You manage to jump into the next cab in line.

  "Do you speak English?" you ask.

  "I speak much English, meestehr."

  "Good, then follow that cab," you tell him.

  Your cab weaves in and out of the heavy traffic, with its horn blaring 
constantly. Your driver just barely misses one car after another. However, he 
does manage to keep less than a block behind the other car.
