  You are anxious to get to the hotel to find Bruce and Andrea. You feel you 
cannot go to Serena's village.
  You thank Serena for her help and slip out of the cart.
  Where are you? The pale moon lights up an eerie landscape. Stretching in 
every direction are small buildings, all deserted. You wander up and down the 
silent streets until you finally see a group of people huddled in front of a 
small fire. The night is cool, and they gesture for you to join them. You stay 
with them until dawn.
  With the light of day you realize that you are in a very large cemetery.
Those small buildings must be tombs! You're not sure of the way out, but you
pick a direction and keep going. Finally you reach a small store just outside 
the cemetery. You find a telephone and call Bruce at the hotel.
