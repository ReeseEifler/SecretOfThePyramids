"I'm sure the radio message got through," you
say.
"I think so too," says Ahmed. "The best thing
to do is to wait where we are."
Ahmed digs around in the sand where you
crouched during the storm.
"Here they are," says Ahmed, "the smoke
bombs. I was afraid that I had lost them. Each
one of these will send out smoke for an hour."
Ahmed sets off one of the bombs. A tall column
of smoke rises in the now still air.
The last one is set off late in the afternoon.
"This is it," says Ahmed. "If no one sees this
smoke, we may be out of luck."
Just as the smoke begins to disappear, you
hear the drone of a plane. It banks and makes a
low pass over you.
"They see us!" you shout, jumping up and
down on the sand.
The plane, which belongs to the Egyptian Air
Force, lands nearby. You are saved this time. You
wonder how many adventures lie ahead before
you get back to the States.
The End
