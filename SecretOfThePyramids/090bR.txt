  You stop for a moment to think. How can you possibly find your way out? Then
you remember a rule to follow when you're trapped in a maze: "Every time you 
reach a fork, turn right." Remembering this calms your nerves somewhat. Now 
maybe you have a chance.

  Wearily you start to retrace your steps. You just hope that the rule works. 
At best you know that it will be a long walk.

                                   THE END
