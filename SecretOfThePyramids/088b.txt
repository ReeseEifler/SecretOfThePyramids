  "We'll take the back stairway down to the basement," says Bruce. "I have a
special car — built for my underwater exploration of the Nile — down there."

controlled door opens, and the car shoots into a pool of water on the other 
side of the door. The car sinks until it is completely underwater, and then 
it starts forward.
