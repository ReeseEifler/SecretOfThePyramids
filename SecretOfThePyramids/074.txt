"I've had enough of being cooped up in narrow
passageways under umpteen tons of rock,"
you say.
"Very well," says Mohammed. "Perhaps I can
take you on a daytime tour of Cairo."
You agree. After a couple of hours of walking
through museums, touring ancient mosques and
city walls, and looking at parks and monuments,
you are very tired. Mohammed finds a colorful
cafe on one of the broad boulevards in the modern
section of Cairo where you can sit and watch
the people go by. You have been sitting there for
awhile when you notice that Mohammed seems
very uneasy.
"Is anything wrong?" you ask.
"Do not move or look around. Several men
who I believe are terrorists have surrounded us.
How they found us, I do not know. They may
have been following us for some time. I can try to
get to a phone, or we can make a run for it. Since
our chances are about the same either way, I will
leave the decision up to you."
