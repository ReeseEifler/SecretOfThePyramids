  "Hurry inside," Andrea says, "and close the door behind you."

  The room you enter is dark, and it takes a few moments for your eyes to 
adjust to the light. When they do, you see Andrea in front of you with a 
revolver in her hand, silencer and all. The gun is pointed at you.
 
 "Kill! I must kill. . . . " she says in a mechanical-sounding voice. Her eyes
are glassy, as if she were hypnotized.
  
  "Andrea, what are you saying?" you gasp.
  
  "The secrets must be protected . . . must be protected. . . . " she continues
in that same strange voice. It sounds almost like a recording.
  
  You realize with a shudder that Andrea's mind has been taken over by some 
evil force.
