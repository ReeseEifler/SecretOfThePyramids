The gap to the next roof is just too wide. You
know that you would never make it across. Serena,
however, is already across and has disappeared.
You turn to face your pursuers. Then you recognize
them.
"Bruce! Andrea!" you exclaim. "It's you. How
did you get here?"
"The cab driver who brought you here was
worried," Bruce says. "He went to the police and
they called us."
Suddenly you realize that you've got to stop
Serena from running away. The three of you can
help her.
"Serena, come back!" you shout. "These are
my friends."
The sound of your voice echoes across the
rooftops, but there is no reply.
You, Bruce, and Andrea return to the hotel.
Your parents are on the overseas phone. They
have begun to worry about you and insist that
you return home.
Back in the States you find that many of your
friends do not believe your story, especially the
part about your new friend the belly dancer.
