"Uncle Bruce!" you exclaim. "Am I glad to see
you. I thought you were a goner when they took
you off in that truck."
"We caught some of the gang members just as
they were trying to smuggle your uncle out of the
city," says Ahmed. "We also have reports that a
severe sandstorm wiped out the terrorists' headquarters
in the desert."
Later, back at the hotel, Bruce tells you some
disappointing news.
"For some reason my instruments under the
pyramid do not seem to be working properly. I
think I'll have to go back to the States and redesign
them. When I come back here the next
time, do you want to come along again?"
"Now that is going to be hard to decide," you
answer.
The End
