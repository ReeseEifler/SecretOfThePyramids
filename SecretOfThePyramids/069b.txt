  "All right," one of them orders, "you two march toward the building over 
there."

  As you walk, you realize just how large the pyramid building is. Though 
clearly not a solid structure like the ancient pyramids—it has rows of 
windows at various heights—it is still twenty or thirty stories high. A large 
mast of some sort rises from the top. The mast is bent sideways to a crazy
angle.

  An electronically controlled door slides open at the base of the pyramid, 
and you are pushed inside.

  "Take them to the throne room," you hear one of the guards order.
