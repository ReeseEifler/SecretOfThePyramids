Up ahead you see another oasis. Is it another
mirage? You head for it anyway. One part of the
desert is as good as any other when it comes to
leaving your sun-dried bones.
You get there first. "This is water! Actual water!"
you exclaim. "This is not a mirage!"
You dunk your entire head in the water. Nothing
has ever felt better in your life.
Later, when you are both rested, Ahmed says,
"Some of these palm trees are date palms with
fruit We will have enough food and water until
the next caravan arrives. It is only a matter of time
before we are rescued."
The End
