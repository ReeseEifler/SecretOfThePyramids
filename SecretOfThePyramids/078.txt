  "Maybe it is better for everyone concerned if I wait at your villa," you tell
Ahmed.

  "All right," he agrees. "I'm certain that you've worked up a real appetite 
after your adventure. We will eat early tonight."

  After dinner you toss and turn for hours. It is difficult for you to sleep, 
worrying about Bruce. Finally you do fall asleep. When you wake up, it is
already late in the morning. Ahmed has long since left to take charge of the 
raid. You walk around the villa. It is very large, with marble floors, wide 
hallways, and high ceilings. But there is an ominous silence about the place.

  You decide to leave. It might be a good idea to go back to the hotel and look
for Andrea.

  When you reach the front door, an armed guard stops you. You go back down the
long hallway until you find a telephone in one of the rooms. The phone doesn't 
work. You suddenly realize that you are a prisoner!
