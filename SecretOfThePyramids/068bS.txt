  "With your help, of course, Professor. Several Russian scientists were on the
verge of completing a particle-beam ray gun. By various means I have had them 
brought here. They have almost completed their work. And now, with you to help 
them, they will be done in no time at all. When it is finished, the ray will be
directed at a mirror on a space platform that I have already placed in orbit
around the earth. I will then be able to bounce the ray back to any point on 
earth, utterly destroying the targets that I choose. If you refuse to help me, 
you will be imprisoned on the space platform. I give you exactly one hour to 
make up your mind."

  The guards take you and Bruce to a small room with barred windows and lock 
you in.
