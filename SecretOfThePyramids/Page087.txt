You wake up to find yourself lying on an iron cot in a small storeroom. You sit
up and try to move, and find that one ankle is chained to the bed.

Gradually your eyes become accustomed to the darkness. There is a small window 
high above you on the wall, and through it you can see a crescent moon shining.
You can hear the beat of the music you heard in the cafe. You sit there in the 
half-darkness trying to figure out how to pick the ancient-looking padlock that
secures the chain on your ankle.

The door to the room opens slightly, throwing a shaft of light inside. It's 
bright enough for you to recognize the dancer from the cafe. Quietly she closes 
the door and whispers in your ear.

"My name is Serena. I will help you escape."

She inserts a long, thin bar into the padlock on your ankle. The lock snaps 
open.

"Here, quickly!" she says. "Stand on my shoulders and climb out the window. It 
leads to a rooftop. I will pull myself up and follow."

You want to go with her, but you have no idea who this woman is and where she 
might be leading you. She could be getting you into a worse situation. You 
look at the window high up on the wall and then at the open door in front of 
you.

                 Do you decide to ACCEPT Serena's help?

                                  OR
        
           You don't trust her, and try to ESCAPE through the door?
