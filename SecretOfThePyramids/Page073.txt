You decide you can trust Serena to help you escape. She slides the iron cot 
over to the door, wedging it closed. And just in time! You hear loud, angry 
voices on the other side as someone bangs and struggles to get in. You and 
Serena jump onto the cot. She cups her hands to give your foot a boost up. Her 
lift sends you sailing through the window.

Flat rooftops stretch in all directions, lit with a silvery light from the 
moon. You turn to help Serena climb up, but she is already beside you.

"Quickly, to the other end of the roof," she orders.

You dash across the roof. 

"They're coming after us!" Serena shouts. "Jump across to the other roof."

You look across and then down. You can't tell how many stories the drop is, 
but it looks like a long way down. The gap seems terrifyingly wide. Can you 
make it if you jump?

                             Do you decide to JUMP?

                                      OR

           Do you decide to take a CHANCE with the people who are after you?
