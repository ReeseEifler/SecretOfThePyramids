  You, Bruce, and Hassan climb down a ladder into the deep pit. At the bottom, 
a six-foot-square opening penetrates the side wall. A perfectly straight tunnel
of the same dimensions goes into the rock—horizontal for a short way, then 
sloping sharply downward. The three of you enter it.

  A hand rope along the wall keeps you from slipping. Your flashlight beams cut
into the darkness ahead. Finally you come to a circular room about twelve feet
in diameter, directly beneath the center of the pyramid.

  "This is strange, very strange," says Hassan. "Yesterday this floor was 
completely smooth, almost polished. Now there is a pattern of cracks over here 
and part of the floor has sunk."

  Suddenly there is a cracking noise.

  "Get back to the tunnel!" shouts Bruce. "The floor is caving in."
