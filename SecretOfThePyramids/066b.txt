  Against your will you walk up a short flight of stairs. Your mind struggles 
against it, but the movements of your body are no longer in your control. You 
lie down in the coffin. The horrible realization of what is happening fills you
with panic — but you are now powerless to move.

  The lid comes down and covers you. You hear the heavy, grinding sound as the 
stone lid of the sarcophagus, weighing many tons, slides into place.

  There is no way out now. You will lie there as long as the stars rise and set
over the desert. You have become part of the secret of the Pyramids.

                                   THE END
