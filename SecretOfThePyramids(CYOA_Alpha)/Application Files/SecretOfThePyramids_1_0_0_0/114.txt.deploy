  You don't really know where you are. It might be safer to go all the way to 
Serena's village.

  You ride for another few hours. There is utter silence except for the 
clip-clop of the donkey's hooves and the creak of the wheels. You drift off to
sleep. Sometime later Serena shakes you gently.

  "We are here, at my village, and with my people." 
  
  You crawl out of the cart. Dawn is just breaking. You are near a field. In 
the center you see a large bonfire. Around the fire are hundreds of figures in
white turbans and white robes. They are chanting in unison — it's an eerie 
sound. Then the figures rise and begin to move together around the fire in a 
strange, slow dance, rolling their heads and chanting, "Allah-Allah-ah-ah." The
hypnotic effect of the dancing draws you in, and you join the circle.
