  Just before dawn the next morning you and Ahmed leave in his small scout 
helicopter.

  You fly east across the desert. The faintest light begins to creep along the 
edge of the sky. Then a thin layer of red, like glowing embers, grows along the
horizon.

  "I plan to mark the route to the terrorists' camp by dropping small smoke 
bombs in the desert at twenty-mile intervals," Ahmed explains. "The troop-
carrying helicopters will leave from a nearby army base in half an hour. They 
will follow the smoke trail."

  As the huge, fiery disc of the sun floats majestically up into the sky, Ahmed
notices some dark clouds low on the horizon to the southeast.
